Hi my name is Pruthvi KV, I am a Data Engineer with over 3 years of experience in building and maintaining data solutions, focusing on technologies like Databricks, Azure Data Factory, ADLS Blob Storage, PySpark, SQL, and Python. My expertise includes developing scalable data pipelines to automate data ingestion, transformation, and loading for large datasets, both in batch and real-time. I have implemented efficient data processing workflows in PySpark within Databricks, leveraging ADLS Blob Storage to handle large-scale data efficiently.

I have been responsible for writing optimized SQL queries for data extraction and transformation from ADLS Blob Storage, ensuring high performance for reporting and analytics. In addition, I have built data workflows in Azure Data Factory to move data between ADLS and various other sources, automating the entire process. Utilizing Python, I have scripted and automated transformations on datasets, improving pipeline efficiency while reducing manual intervention.

Throughout my projects, I have ensured smooth collaboration by managing code versioning with GitHub and tracking tasks using Jira in an agile environment. I have also monitored and optimized Databricks clusters for better resource utilization, minimizing costs while ensuring high performance. Furthermore, I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to implement best practices for data storage and processing in ADLS Blob Storage, maintaining data quality, accuracy, and consistency across various layers in the architecture.
